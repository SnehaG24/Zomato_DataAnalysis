# Zomato_DataAnalysis
I developed a Zomato analysis project using Python, leveraging Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn's countplot function. In this project, I explored various insights, such as the types of restaurants that the majority of customers order from, the number of votes each type of restaurant has received, the common price ranges for orders on Zomato, and customer preferences for service modesâ€”online or offline , and visualized all these insights by plotting line graphs, bar charts, and histograms using Matplotlib and Seaborn. This analysis was conducted in Jupyter Notebook.
